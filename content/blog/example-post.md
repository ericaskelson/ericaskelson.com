This is an example blog post written in Markdown. You can write your posts in simple, readable text and they'll be rendered beautifully on the site.

## Subheadings Work Great

You can organize your thoughts with headings. Just use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections.

### Formatting Options

You can use **bold text** for emphasis, or *italics* for a softer touch. You can also combine them for ***bold italics***.

Lists are easy too:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Or numbered lists:

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Code Examples

If you want to share code, you can use inline code like `calculateReserve()` or code blocks:

```python
def calculate_reserve(claims, factor):
    return sum(claims) * factor
```

## Blockquotes

> "The actuary's role is to make financial sense of the future."
>
> — Someone wise, probably

## Links and Images

You can add [links to other sites](https://www.soa.org) easily.

That's the basics! Markdown is intuitive and keeps your focus on writing rather than formatting.
