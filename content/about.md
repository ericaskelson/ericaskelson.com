# About Me

*Beyond the spreadsheets and mortality tables*

## The Short Version

I'm an actuary based in Birmingham, Alabama. By day, I work on life insurance valuation at Protective Life. Outside of work, I'm passionate about finding ways to make complex processes simpler and more elegant.

## What Drives Me

I believe that the best solutions are often the simplest ones. Whether it's automating a tedious calculation, building a training program, or explaining actuarial concepts to non-actuaries, I'm always looking for ways to reduce complexity and increase clarity.

My favorite projects are the ones where I can take something that "has always been done this way" and find a better approach. Introducing Git version control to actuarial model management was one of those projects that I'm particularly proud of.

## Why This Website

I built this site to have a home on the internet that I control. In an age of social media platforms that come and go, there's something appealing about having your own corner of the web.

It also gave me an excuse to learn a bit more about web development, which turns out to be quite different from the SQL and Excel I use day-to-day.
